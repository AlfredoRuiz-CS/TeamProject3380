We used pnpm so you will need to make sure you install pnpm, it's very similar to npm.

All you need to do to start up the frontend/client is to cd into the client folder.
Then you will run the command 'pnpm run dev'.
This will start up the development Vite server and it should interact with out hosted Azure database and Vercel Backend.
